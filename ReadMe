This is a simple movie ticket booking app that retrieves data from a local server and displays it on a web page. Users can select a movie from the list and view its details, including the poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets. They can also purchase tickets by clicking the "Buy Ticket" button.
Prerequisites

To run this app, you need to have a local server running on your machine. You can use json-server or any other server of your choice.
Installation

    Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-ticket-booking-app.git
    Navigate to the project directory: cd movie-ticket-booking-app
    Install dependencies: npm install
    Start the server: npm run server
    Open the app in your browser: http://localhost:8080

Usage

The app consists of two main functions that render movie details and films list on the web page. The renderMovieDetails function takes a movie object as a parameter and updates the poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets fields on the web page.

The renderFilmsList function takes an array of films and creates a list of clickable items that, when clicked, display the details of the selected movie using the renderMovieDetails function.

The app uses the fetch method to make a GET request to the server to retrieve films data. Upon successful retrieval, the app renders the films list and loads the details for the first movie in the list.

The buyTicketButton event listener allows users to purchase tickets for the selected movie. If tickets are available, the app decrements the available tickets count and displays a success message. If no tickets are available, the app displays an error message.
